= How Super Stripe Works =

We’ve built a secure, robust, cloud-based payment system (superstripeapp.com) that our WordPress plugin uses to process payments with Stripe.

This is great news for you because you won’t ever have to worry about security or PCI compliance on your webserver … its ultra-simple to get setup … and you don’t even need to go through the hassle of buying an SSL certificate and configuring it on your website … it just works.

All you’ll need to do to get this setup is:

1. Register for a free account on superstripeapp.com
2. Follow the instructions during registration to connect your Stripe account and get an API key
3. Download & Install the Super Stripe WordPress plugin
4. Enter the API key from your superstripeapp.com registration into the Super Stripe options page on your website
5. Place a shortcode on a page on your site to place a buy now button on it

That’s it!

And you can use this on an unlimited number of sites after you have your API key.

= Is this Free? =

We are committed to making this the easiest to use payment solution for WordPress based merchants so we’ve set it up so we only make money when you do–that’s why this plugin and cloud based service are free … all we do is charge a flat 4.9% fee on top of each transaction.

Stripe also assesses a 2.3% + $0.30 fee on each transaction. So the way this works is if you billed someone $15 then you’d actually collect $13.63 after fees — which Stripe will automatically deposit directly into your bank account.

= Is Super Stripe available to international merchants? =

Stripe can charge credit cards from any place in the world but Stripe is currently only available to merchants in the United States and Canada — and since Super Stripe is fully dependent on Stripe, it too is limited to merchants living in the United States and Canada.
