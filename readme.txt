= How Super Stripe Works =

We've built a secure, robust, cloud-based payment system (superstripeapp.com) that our WordPress plugin uses to process payments with Stripe.

This is great news for you because you won't ever have to worry about security or PCI compliance on your webserver.

Super Stripe is ultra-simple to get setup ... it doesn't require your site to be hosted with a dedicated IP address or to have an SSL certificate installed.

After your user fills out and Submits the Buy Now form they will be redirected to our secure servers to checkout. Once the checkout is complete (or the user cancels), the user will be redirected back to your site to a customizable thank you page.

Super Stripe sends sale notifications to any number of email address you want (specified when creating the form) and sends a very customizable email receipt to the customer.

You can embed protected links to files into your customer sale notifications and on the thank you page you setup for your super stripe forms.

You can integrate your payment forms with Mailchimp and/or AWeber to add customers to your mailing lists.

= Pricing =

We're committed to making this the easiest to use payment solution for WordPress available so we've set it up so you'll only be charged for using this service when you make money.

Using our secure servers with Stripe costs 4.4% + 45¢ per successful transaction.

For example, if you successfully charge someone $20 then after fees you'll collect $18.67 — which Stripe will automatically deposit directly into your bank account.

The fee above already includes Stripe's fee (2.9% + 30¢) -- we just add an additional 1.5% + 15¢ for the use of our secure servers -- which makes a grand total of 4.4% + 45¢ per successful transaction.

= Does Super Stripe integrate with any Affiliate Program software? =

Yes. Super Stripe works seamlessly with our affiliate tracking plugin [Affiliate Royale](http://www.affiliateroyale.com "Affiliate Royale") so you can easily track affiliate commissions when running transactions through it.

= Is Super Stripe available to international merchants? =

Stripe is currently only available to merchants in the United States and Canada — and since Super Stripe is fully dependent on Stripe, it too is limited to merchants living in the United States and Canada.

= How can I run test transactions through this system? =

When you create a payment form with Super Stripe you can easily specify whether transactions created with it should be test or live transactions (using the livemode attribute). There are no fees (from Stripe or our servers) for running test transactions.

We recommend setting up forms initially in test mode to get the payment flow working properly before charging real transactions. Once you're satisfied that the payment flow works for you then it's easy to set the form to live by changing the value of the livemode attribute from "false" to "true".
